Hello, My name is Ghosty, Doki Doki Lunar was an project i was working on a few months ago, I am hoping that after my exams, I will continue Doki Doki Lunar.
All edits to Doki Doki Lunar will be published here, I don't have much experience on making ddlc mods but i hope i can finish this project by atleast the end of 2021
i made this github because, 1. I was losing a bit of interest in ddlc (DDLC+ came out so i have more to work with.) 2. I lost hope by thinking that Doki Doki Lunar would never
be a good ddlc mod, but now i dont care, I just want to release this mod and anyone who wants to play, can play. 3. I was kind of losing space so i decided i would postpone the mod
until i got more space (which i did)

I will start working on the mod again by the end of october. Thank you for reading this long note.
